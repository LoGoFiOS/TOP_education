    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or 
        breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, 
        and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by 
        adding your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before 
        cooking.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick®)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li></li>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a sheet pan 
            (approx. 13 x18 inches) or jelly roll pan (12x17 inches) with parchment paper. 
            Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.
        </p>
        <li></li>
        <p>
            Beat butter, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a 
            large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until 
            completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches 
            apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
        </p>
        <li></li>
        <p>
            Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon 
            in a large mixing bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well combined, but 
            don't overmix. Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan.
        </p>
        <li></li>
        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
        </p>
        <li></li>
        <p>
            Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper with 
            the pancake from the pan and set it onto a cutting board. Slice the 
            pancake sheet into squares using a pizza cutter or into your desired shapes with a cookie cutter.
        </p>
